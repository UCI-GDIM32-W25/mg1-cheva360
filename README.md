### Write about how the plan you wrote in the MG1 break-down activity connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.

The code I wrote connects to my initial plan in several ways.
- I created code for the player allows movement with wasd keys and the ability to plant with space, as outlined in my plan
- I gave the same attritbues / components to the player, seed, and ui (sprite renderer and text renderer)
- The ui and ability to plant seeds is dictated by the code *(Cant plant more than 5 seeds, text updates after seeds are planted.)*
